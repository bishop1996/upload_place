Load any website from the web into Framer X. This can be very valuable if you need specific functionality from your website quickly, and can layer over the web page to reflect changes to content.
- Drag component onto canvas (default is Surfer.com)
- Expand component (responsive) to show as much of the website as you’d want to show
- From the property panel change the URL for the webpage you want to load
- If you want to scroll through it as it’s intended on the web create the screen you’ll be using as a frame on the canvas, draw a scroll over that screen and connect the scroll to the iframe!
